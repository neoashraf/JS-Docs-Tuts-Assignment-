Input:
Input starts with an integer t = total test cases (1<t<=50), 
Each test case starts with an integer n = total number of comments (1<n<=10000),
Each comment starts with three integers, c = the index of its parent(0<=i<n-2), i = its own index(1<=i<=n), p = priority of the comment(1<=p<=100000), then followed by a string m = comment

Output:
It'll obviously starts with the comment that has parent index 0 BUT there are 3 rules:
	1. Comments with the same parent index has to be sort out by their priority value and with the highest priority will show first.
	2. If some comments have same priority and same parent index then it has to be sorted out by their index. Comments with lower index value will show first.
	3. After showing a comment if it has child comments then the child comments will show by following these three rules and repeat.

Now for each comment output at first put some '-' regarding the depth of the comment, then the comment's index and followed by the comment

Each test casses will be separated by 10 '='.
